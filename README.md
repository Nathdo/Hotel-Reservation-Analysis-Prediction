# Hotel-Reservation-Analysis-Prediction

I'm finishing an exciting Python project that aims to predict hotel cancellations from online booking data. When customers book hotel rooms online, a large percentage of those reservations are canceled, which can negatively affect hotel revenue. My goal is therefore to develop a machine learning model capable of predicting whether a reservation will be canceled or honored.

In this project, I start with data analysis using Pandas to clean the data and do some initial exploration. Next, I'll do Imputation to fill in the missing values, then Encoding to convert the categorical data into numeric variables. Then, I will develop several machine learning models using the Scikit-Learn library. I will tune these models using different optimization techniques to improve their accuracy.

Finally, I will evaluate the performance of my model and choose the most accurate final model. I'm really passionate about this project because it allows me to explore machine learning techniques and solve a real problem for the hospitality industry.
